# Redux-based Invoice Management System

Welcome to the Redux-based Invoice Management System! This project addresses the task assigned as part of the interview process, involving the development of a simple invoice management system using React and Redux.

### This site is live on - [Invoice Manager](https://swipe-invoice-manager.vercel.app/).

## Project Overview

This project is an extension of an existing GitHub repository created by John Uberbacher. The goal was to implement features related to invoice creation, management, and state management using Redux.

## Completed Tasks

#### Redux Integration
Integrated Redux into the application by creating a Redux store.

#### Redux Actions, Action Types, and Reducers
Created Redux actions, action types, and reducers to manage the invoice state (add, edit, view, and delete invoices).

#### Invoice List Component
Implemented a component to display a list of invoices

#### UI Refinement
Set the list of invoices as the first screen upon application launch.\
Moved the create invoice functionality to a new button.

#### Operations in Invoice List
Enhanced the invoice list by adding buttons or options for view, edit, and delete operations.

#### State Management
Ensured proper state management throughout the application by connecting components to the Redux store.

#### Additional Functionality
Implemented "Copy to New Invoice" functionality, allowing users to duplicate an existing invoice.

## Scripts to initiate the application locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all the dependencies which the app required to run.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Conclusion
All the tasks have been completed successfully. The project is now ready for review.\
Thank you for the opportunity, and I look forward to discussing the implementation further.

Best regards,
